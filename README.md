RAINminder

This is a project that I started during my 


The below was tested on a Android Emulator:
Phone Model: Pixel 2
Android version: 10.0 (Android Q, API Level 29)

Currently working:
  - getting your location
  - getting the weather for your location (based on [OpenWeather.org](https://openweathermap.org/)
  - checking whether there is rain today
  - Providing you a reply whether today is a fine day or there is rain
  - able to set a timer for when you leave home (currently works only for the SAME day)
  - once timer is set, it will render a reminder at the setup time (currently only working in foreground, active state)


Future tasks:
  - structure the code into separate components
  - allow to choose a date (or day of week) to automate the check (for example tomorrow, or each friday)
  - hide the get weather button
  - show the location info ? City Name
  - allow to add Destinations and check the weather there too
  - add a slider to change the advance warning time (1 to 10 minutes)
  - look into push notifications
  - make app working in the background
  - work on iOS version
